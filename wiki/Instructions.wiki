#summary How to use this package

= Usage Instructions =

The source code contains CAST's plugin to SVG-edit, but not SVG-edit itself.  We have confirmed that it is compatible with SVG-edit revision 2048, and these build instructions are based on that version.  It may work with later versions of SVG-edit but this has not yet been tested.

  # Check out the source from [http://code.google.com/p/cwm-drawtool/source/checkout the source page].
  # Confirm that your subversion client has correctly followed the external reference and included the proper version of SVG-edit in a subdirectory called `src/main/resources/org/cast/cwm/drawtool/svgedit`.
  # Look in `src/main/resources/org/cast/cwm/drawtool/` for HTML files you can use:
    * view `SvgEditor.html` for a full screen version (not for general use)
    * view `TestFrame.html` for a properly sized version of the interface.


For usage as a Wicket module, you would do something like this:

{{{
    String defaultContent = ... your svg here ...;
    ArrayList<String> starterUrls = ... urls of starter imgs here...;

    SvgEditor svgEditor = new SvgEditor();
    if (defaultContent != null)
        svgEditor.setSvg(defaultContent);
    if (starterUrls != null)
        svgEditor.setDrawingStarters(starterUrls);
    InlineFrame frame = svgEditor.getEditor("svgeditor");
    add(frame);
}}}
